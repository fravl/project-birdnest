# project-birdnest
This is a small web-application which is a solution to the pre-assignment for the Reaktor Summer Internship 2023. It demonstrates a push-architecture where the backend fetches data from an external api every 2 seconds, processes it, and finally sends it to the frontend using Server-Sent-Events. The frontend then displays the data in a list.
